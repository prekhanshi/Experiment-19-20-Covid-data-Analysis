## 🚀 Steps Performed  

### 1. Data Loading  
- Imported dataset using `pd.read_csv()`  
- Displayed initial records using `.head()`

### 2. Data Cleaning  
- Dropped unnecessary columns (`SNo`, `Last Update`)  
- Converted data types:
  - `ObservationDate` → datetime  
  - `Confirmed`, `Deaths`, `Recovered` → integer  

### 3. Feature Engineering  
- Created a new column for Active Cases:
### 4. Data Exploration
Checked dataset structure using .info()
Identified the latest date in the dataset
Filtered data for the most recent records
### 5. Global Analysis
Grouped data by country
Calculated total confirmed, deaths, recovered, and active cases
Identified top affected countries:
US
India
Brazil
France
Turkey
### 6. Visualization
Created a world choropleth map using Plotly
### 7. India-Specific Analysis
Filtered dataset for India
Found total number of states/UTs
Listed all states
### 8. Data Cleaning (India States)
Replaced 'Unknown' values with NaN
Filled missing values using mode
### 9. Latest India Data Analysis
Extracted latest COVID data for India
Compared cases across states
### 10. Top Affected States in India
Maharashtra (highest cases)
Karnataka
Kerala
Tamil Nadu
Uttar Pradesh
### 📊 Key Results
Total Countries Analyzed: 195
Most Affected Country: US
Second Most Affected: India
Most Affected State in India: Maharashtra
Total Indian States/UTs: 38
### 📚 Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates how pandemic data can be analyzed using Pandas. It helps in understanding global and national trends of COVID-19 and builds foundational data analysis skills.
